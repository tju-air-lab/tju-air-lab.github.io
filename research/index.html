 <h3>Advanced Control Technology and It's Applications in Robots</h3>
 
 <div align="center"><img src="../images/research/1.png"  width="700" height="inherit" alt="research1"/></div>

<p class="justify1">This research direction concentrates on developing advanced control 
 methodologies to stabilize robots under extreme conditions, such as agile flight and 
 strong wind disturbance. The long-lerm goal is to realize the ultimate control capability 
 of the robot to enhance the system's robustness and adaptability.

<h3>Learning Agile Flight in Complex Environments</h3>
 
 <div align="center"><img src="../images/research/2.png"  width="700" height="inherit" alt="research2"/></div>

<p class="justify1">This research direction focuses on perception, artificial intelligence,
 and autonomous navigation of robots, encompassing areas such as deep learning, reinforcement 
 learning, and motion planning. We are dedicated to learning the intelligence policy of robots 
 to navigate autonomously in complex environments and pushing the boundaries to make it faster, 
 simpler, and more efficient.

<h3>Collaborative SLAM</h3>
 
 <div align="center"><img src="../images/research/3.png"  width="700" height="inherit" alt="research3"/></div>

<p class="justify1">This research direction is dedicated to develope collaborative simultaneous localization 
 and mapping (SLAM) methods among multiple robots using visual sensors, inertial sensors and radar in various
 complex environments. We aim to enable robot teams to flexibly adapt to changes in cluster topology and 
 communication topology, suppress odometry drift as much as possible, and achieve globally consistent localization 
 to adapt complex task scenarios.

<p class="justify1">The objective of this research is to generate safe and smooth motions for robots' 
 autonomous navigation, even in challenging environments characterized by unforeseen, dynamically changing, 
 and rich obstacles. The proposed approaches have been applied to various scenarios, including but not 
 limited to formation flight and collaborative exploration.
