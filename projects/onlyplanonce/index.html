	In this work, we propose a learning-based onestage 
planner for trajectory generation of quadrotor in obstaclecluttered environment 
without relying on explicit map. We integrate perception and mapping, 
front-end path searching,and back-end optimization into a single network.
 We frame the motion planning problem as a regression of spatially separated
polynomial trajectories and associated scores. Specifically, our
approach adopts a set of motion primitives to cover the searching
space, and predicts the offsets and scores of primitives for
local optimization in a single forward propagation. A novel
unsupervised learning strategy, termed guidance learning, is
developed to provide numerical gradients as the guidance for
training. We train the network policy with privileged information
about the surroundings while only the noisy depth observations
are available during inference. Finally, a series of experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and time-efficiency
of the proposed method in both simulation and real-world.
