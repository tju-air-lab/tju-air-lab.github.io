		The Autonomous Intelligent Robotics Laboratory at Tianjin University (TJU-AIR-LAB) 
		focuses on multi-robot cooperative SLAM, intelligent decision, motion planning, 
		disturbance rejection control, and the applications of learning algorithms in robots 
		with complex environments. The team is led by a group of highly motivated and 
		talented graduate and undergraduate students. Our AIR group aims at pushing the boundary 
		of robot autonomy and safety.

	<p class="justify1">
		The TJU-AIR-LAB continuously looks for highly self-motivated students and visiting 
		scholas from all engineering disciplines to join our group. Priority consideration 
		for those with robot and machine learning background. Please email us with your interest.
